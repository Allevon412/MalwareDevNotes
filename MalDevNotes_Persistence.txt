#Low Privilege Persistence Mehtods.
- Start Folder & Registry Keys - 
- We can upload an implant to the startup folder %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup. Uploading the implant here would give us persistence when the computer is restarted our payload would run.
- We can also create a lnk file in the startup folder to our implant executable and it will run at startup.

- We can also edit the registry key for HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run | RunOnce.
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v MSUpdate /t REG_SZ /d C:\path_to_implant.exe /f


- Logon Scripts -
- When the user logins to the system, there is a process called user-init that launches local logon scripts.
- All you have to do is set a value in the registry in order to make this work.
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment - If you add an additional value to the Environment key, you're telling user-init to run this script at logon.
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment" /v UserInitMprLogonScript /d "C:\path_to_script.bat" /t REG_SZ /f

.bat contents - 
@ECHO OFF

C:\path_to_binary\implant.exe

- Shortcut Modifications - 
- Requires enduser to use a shortcut on desktop or taskbar icon. Just right click on the shortcut icon go to the properties tab and change the target. The sektor7 course uses a VBS script to modify the target to another vbs script that will execute the implant & then execute the original lnk target.
