# MalwareDevNotes
THis is going to be a repository to hold &amp; take my malware development notes so I don't have to swap back and forth between laptops / desktops.

This is just a repository to store my notes on some malware development concepts such as evasion / persistence / privEsc. The source is mainly institute.sektor7.net.
